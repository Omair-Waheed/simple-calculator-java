Individual Git Exercise
• Come up with a small programming exercise for yourself (write a sortable array in Java or somethingsimple)
• Set up git on your machine, create a Github account, and create a new repo for this exercise.
• Think of at least 2 independent features that your exercise will accomplish. For the sortable array, it could be sorting a list of integers and sorting a list of strings.
• Clone the repository locally, so now you can work offline on your own machine. But be sure to still follow the git process even if it's only you working on your machine for this exercise.
• Set up branches for each of these features; this means you must have at least three branches, including master.
• Push each of these new branches to GitHub and observe they exist in the branch list.
• Now that you are all setup, practice commits, push, pull, and inline code documentation by doing the following for each feature you are developing:
o Note that you are always developing locally on your own machine.
o Switch to the master branch and pull master from the remote repository (origin). This ensures your local copy is up-to-date.
o You will start developing the code for your first feature. Switch to the correct feature branch, merge master into the feature branch, and develop code for the feature. Make sure the feature works by writing tests for it (it can be as simple as a few JUnit tests). Commit it to the feature branch.
o You may wish to commit your code more frequently if your features are more complicated. (It's probably not needed for this exercise though.)
o Make sure to create or update the repo's README.md with instructions on what your feature is and how to use it.
o Push the feature branch to the remote repository (origin).
o Create a pull request in GitHub from the feature branch to the master branch, and merge it.
o Pull the updated master branch on your local machine and make sure it updates with the code from GitHub.
• View the stats on your repo at GitHub
• Repeat the above development steps until you have completed the exercise.
• Create a short video demo of your work so that the video must:
o Be approximately 3 minutes long
o Be a screen capture of your desktop during the demo
o Make sure the font size is big enough for us to see in order to grade you accordingly
o Make sure your video shows all 3 things:
1. Show your Github account and the repo with your work
▪ In your repo, navigate to Insights, select Network, and show the network graph of your repo
2. Show you running the program you created
▪ Make sure you talk through this demo so we know what you are trying to program, what the in/outputs are
▪ Run the tests you created and show the output
▪ Explain what the expected in/outputs are and show if the test cases you ran worked or not
3. Make a simple change locally and push to origin
▪ Locally, make a simple change like add an inline comment to your code
▪ Commit the change and push to origin
▪ Be sure to show the result of that on your machine so that all changes have been pushed successfully
• Grading:
o You will not be graded on the completeness of the code, or the originality of the program, or how many tests you write
o You will only be graded based on whether you have followed the Git process as described above
o In particular, you will lose marks for the following, if the video suggests any of the following:
1. If you do not have/use a Github account
2. If you do have a repo for this exercise on your Github account
3. If your repo has fewer than 3 branches
4. If your repo's README.md is not documented
5. If you cannot show a simple change committed and pushed onto the remote repo (origin)
6. Or other items that indicate you did not follow the above Git process
o While we are not checking the quality of your code, this exercise asks for a simple program. So you can have bugs and potentially still get full marks here, but make sure your bugs do not interfere with the demo of what we need to see. To avoid having bugs, just write a simpler program.
